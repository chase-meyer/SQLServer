Yes, taking a transaction log backup will allow you to mark inactive Virtual Log Files (VLFs) for truncation, making the shrink operation effective. As for the ideal size to shrink the log file to, it depends on your database's specific workload and recovery requirements. Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

---

### 1. **Monitor Log File Usage**
   - Use the following query to check the current and maximum space used by the transaction log:
     ```sql
     DBCC SQLPERF(LOGSPACE);
     ```
   - This will show you the percentage of the transaction log file currently in use. Aim to size the log file with enough headroom for peak transaction activity.

---

### 2. **Understand Workload Patterns**
   - If your database has periodic spikes (e.g., during nightly ETL processes or batch jobs), ensure the transaction log is large enough to accommodate these spikes without frequent auto-growth events.
   - Frequent log growth can degrade performance, so it's better to set a reasonable size proactively.

---

### 3. **Recommendations Based on Database Size**
   - For small-to-medium-sized databases: Start with a log file size of **25% to 30% of the database size**.
   - For large databases or those with high transaction volumes: Analyze the historical log usage during peak times and add a buffer (e.g., 25%-50% above the peak usage).

---

### 4. **Avoid Over-Shrinking**
   - Shrinking the log file too much can result in frequent auto-growth operations, which are costly in terms of performance.
   - Instead, shrink it to a stable size that meets the demands of your workload, and allow some space for growth.

---

### Example:
If your database is 100 GB and your transaction log usage typically peaks at 10 GB, you could shrink the log file to **15-20 GB**. This gives you enough room for growth while preventing unnecessary auto-growth events.

---

### Optional: Set Auto-Growth Settings
After shrinking, ensure your log file's auto-growth settings are configured for efficiency:
- Use increments of **512 MB to 1 GB** for large workloads, instead of smaller sizes (e.g., 1 MB or 10 MB).
- This prevents frequent and inefficient log file growth during high transaction activity.

No, `DBCC SHRINKFILE` does not specifically remove the oldest data from the transaction log. Instead, it works by reclaiming unused space in the log file. Here's how it operates:

1. **Transaction Log Structure**:
   - The transaction log is divided into **Virtual Log Files (VLFs)**. These VLFs are used to store log records sequentially.
   - When you run `DBCC SHRINKFILE`, it attempts to shrink the log file by moving active VLFs to the beginning of the file and truncating the unused space at the end.

2. **Active vs. Inactive VLFs**:
   - Only **inactive VLFs** (those no longer needed for recovery) can be truncated. Active VLFs, which contain log records required for ongoing transactions or replication, cannot be removed.

3. **Backup Requirement**:
   - To mark VLFs as inactive, you typically need to perform a **transaction log backup** (if the database is in Full or Bulk-Logged recovery mode). Without this, the log cannot be truncated effectively.

4. **Behavior**:
   - `DBCC SHRINKFILE` does not prioritize removing the "oldest" log records. Instead, it focuses on reclaiming space by truncating the log file from the end, provided the space is no longer in use.

If you're encountering issues with shrinking the log file, it might be due to active transactions, replication, or other factors. Let me know if you'd like help troubleshooting!

You should keep the backup of the transaction log until you're confident that:

1. **Your database is stable**: 
   - Ensure that no issues have arisen after the shrink operation, such as unexpected growth or corruption.
   - Verify the database's transactional and recovery processes are functioning normally.

2. **You have a newer log backup**:
   - If your database is in Full or Bulk-Logged recovery mode, transaction log backups form a chain. Deleting an older log backup prematurely can break the chain, preventing recovery to a point in time.
   - Only delete a transaction log backup after taking a newer log backup and verifying its integrity.

3. **Retention Policies Are Met**:
   - Follow your organization's retention policies for transaction log backups. This is critical for compliance or recovery strategies.

---

### Rule of Thumb:
- **If there's no immediate need to delete the log backup**, it's wise to keep it as part of a standard backup retention cycle (e.g., 7, 14, or 30 days, depending on your policy).
- If your log backups are automated (e.g., via SQL Server Agent or other tools), and the chain remains unbroken with newer backups, you should be safe to delete older backups according to your retention policy.
